    <p style="font-family: Courier">Legend is apart of a trilogy with many small stories off of the original books. Legend, Prodigy, and Champion. There are many characters who appear first in Legend, but there are also many other characters that join them on the journey. Two of the three original books have a graphic novel to illustrate the story. </p>
