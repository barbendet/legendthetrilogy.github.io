    <p style="font-family: Courier">He was born into the slums of the Republic's Lake Sector. He is led to believe that he failed his trial with a score of 674 (45%), but during the events of Legend, June discovers he had scored 1500 (100%). Day is the Republic's most-wanted criminal and was the prime suspect of the death of Metias Iparis, before June finds out the actual culprit. This one piece of knowledge is what leads them on.Day is described by June to be extremely attractive, with long shoulder-length blonde hair and blue eyes. His main ethnicity is Mongolian but his second ethnicity is Caucasian (Russian, according to Marie Lu's Reddit). He is also very agile, as it is stated that he can climb 4 stories in 5 seconds.He is sarcastic, bold, cocky, and overly confident. His flirtatious attitude is very prominent throughout the series, especially around June. Like all teenage boys, he can be oblivious to other's feelings, and sometimes lets anger or jealousy take hold of him. He is compassionate and protects those he cares about, and he is slow to trust. He is incredibly smart, always planning and calculating (though not as much as June), but in some cases is very rash. He tries to stay strong and because of that, he is very determined. He is very caring, and always tries to do what he thinks is best to his closest friends and family, but sometimes it turns out to be the wrong decision.</p>

Born into an elite Republic family, her parents (Michael and Nadia Iparis) were mysteriously killed in a car crash, leaving her older brother Metias to care for her.

June is of mixed ethnicity. Her dominant ethnicity is Native (Native American), along with Caucasian and a mix of other races. She is described as having a lean, athletic build.June is very logical, selfless, and sympathetic towards others. However, she might come across as a little cold and unfeeling, being not attuned to express her emotions as frequently as others.  She empathizes well and is aware of her emotions despite her stoic front and unwillingness to emotionally express herself. June is also very clever and observant, due to her talents, and this is shown in Prodigy when she asks Day to tell her about his first kiss so that she would remain awake.June was very little when her parents died in a planned car crash. She grew up with her brother, Metias, as her parent. At age ten, she passed her Trial (1500/1500) and went to high school for two years. At age twelve she graduated high school and went to Drake University. At age fifteen, June graduated college due to the death of her brother, Metias.

    <p style="font-family: Courier">Tess has reddish-brown hair, brown eyes, and tan skin. In Prodigy, she cuts her hair short, causing Day not to notice her at first.It is said that Tess was the youngest of a family of 5 children. Her parents, not having enough money to feed everyone, threw her out of the house when she was about 9 years old. She was rummaging through a trash can when Day first called out to her. Day asked her if he could join her, she didn`t respond though so he joined her anyways. When Day got within ten feet from her, Tess screamed and ran away, tripping in the process. When he ran over to her to help her, she started crying and tried to defend herself from him. Day then offered to help her, and she agreed and now the two have been closer than ever.Tess is very kind and caring, and she takes care of Day a lot (before and during Legend). She is protective and depends on Day at the beginning of Legend. For that reason, she was very stingy and cold to June during Prodigy. She matures a lot in Champion, since she no longer depends on Day. Since coming to terms that Day is not her only protector now, she becomes good friends with June and regularly comes to her birthdays in the epilogue.</p>
